# Castlevania-NES-Unity3d

A remake of Castlevania NES version by Unity3d 

# How to use

This is a Unity3d repo. If you want to refer to source code, make sure you can understand the C#.
The project is mostly event driven and in loose OOP design with compromise on game programming.

# Play

Without any code involvement, you can still play the game in Windos/Mac where Unity Web Installer is availble.
You can enter the game by going into the gateway webpage. 
There is a classic level which resembles the original castlevania game and a custom level as a toy.
